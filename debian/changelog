ros-noetic-robot-upstart (0.4.1-1buster) buster; urgency=high

  * Enable customization of  After= in service (#104 <https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/robot_upstart/issues/104>)
    * Cosmetic
    Remove unnecessary parenthesis.
    * Correct typo
    * FIX: Remove unreachable code
    * Enable customizable After= in service
    This feature enables the user to define the services after which the
    generated service will. This is handy when hardware-related system
    services have to start before the ROS software.
  * Added util-linux as dependency for setpriv.
  * Bumped CMake version to avoid author warning.

    Problem addressed
    =================
    When --job option is not passed to rosrun robot_upstart install, the job name gets determined automatically but the logic of it is not clear.
    Solution to the problem
    =======================
    Add an explanation to the document.
  * [CI][kinetic-devel] Update to Xenial. (#79 <https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/robot_upstart/issues/79>)
    * [CI][kinetic-devel] Update to Xenial.
    On a PR https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/robot_upstart/pull/78 I saw [CI failure](https://travis-ci.org/clearpathrobotics/robot_upstart/builds/507510733?utm_source=github_status&utm_medium=notification) that seems to be related to platform issue. Using trusty for xenial-based job might not work (any more?).
    * [CI] Switch to industrial_ci. Add ROS2 dashing.
    * [CI] Remove ROS2 dashing for now (see https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/robot_upstart/pull/79#issuecomment-533908848).
  * Add support for wait flag in the install script (#73 <https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/robot_upstart/issues/73>)

ros-noetic-robot-upstart (0.1.1-1buster) buster; urgency=high

  * Python Rewrite
  * The startup event is too early for ROS to start, use local-filesystems instead.
  * Remove bash versions of the install and uninstall utilities.
  * Add support for supplying the --wait flag to roslaunch.
  * Add Sphinx documentation.
    To get the argparse docs required moving most of the install
    script to a module, which probably should have been done anyway.
  * Add a new-implementation install script, refactor Provider to be a class rather than function.
  * Add roslint.
  * Initial implementation of Python job generator.
  * Port templated files to use empy.
    This gets rid of the bespoke templating system that was so bad. Also
    notable here is adding a --root flag to install somewhere other than
    the actual root. This needs to be further fleshed out, for example
    by not reinvoking with sudo when installing to non-root location.
  * use LANG=C for ifconfig
  * add argument to specify log directory
